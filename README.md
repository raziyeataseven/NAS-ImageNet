# Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning

This repository is the official implementation of [NEURAL ARCHITECTURE SEARCH WITH REINFORCEMENT LEARNING](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01578v2.pdf). 


## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

>Some information about the data and where to get...

## Project files

* __model.py__
	* Includes a CNN model which applies 2D convolution over the input.
	* Returns forward pass output. 
* __controller.py__
	* The Agent which is driven by a neural network architecture.
	* Agent has Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. 
* __policy_gradient.py__
	* Aim of this policy build the Convulutional Neural Network model and compare the results with Reinforcement Learning algorithm 
	* CNN model trainded through play_episode method
	* Play_episode method retuns episode logits from Agent, reward(accuracy) and sum of weighted episode logits.
	* Calculate_loss method calculates and returns policy loss and entropy with logits and weighted logits probabilities within the epoches. 
	* Clearing gradients
	* Backpropagation
	* Update the parameters
	* List avarge total rewards and entropy for each epoch
* __train.py__
	* Includes hyperparameters # of epochs, learning rate, batch size, # of hiden nodes etc.
	* Downloads train and test dataset, and passes it with the config parameters to the model.


## Training

Hyperparameters are defined within the config. To train the model in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py
```
